Mardlamock-DeathRocket
======================
##Motor

* Chamber
	* Inner chamber length: 2cm
		* **This can't be right? Guessing 43cm**
	* Inner chamber diam: 4.34cm
* Nozzle
	* **I am assuming these were switched in the reddit post** 
	* Nozzle throat diam: 1.25cm
	* Nozzle exit diam: 4.34cm
* Motor casing
	* **Assuming 2 inch schedule 40** 
	* 5cm diam, 32mm thick white pvc.
		* **I think these are wrong, no PVC is that thick**
		* **Assuming***
		* 5cm OD
		* 4.34cm ID
		* 3.2mm Thickness
		* 4.34cm + .64mm = 5cm 
* Motor length overall: 65cm,
* Motor empty weight 550g approx

##Fuel

* Sugar is regular tabletop sugar
* 1 KG Fuel
	* 350g of it for real rocket
		* **This must be just the sugar** 
	* Assuming 650g KN 
* o/f ratio is 65:35
* Fuel density: 0.302g/cm3,
* Fuel grain geometry
	* regular bates grain
	* **How Many? Guessing 4 from size & weight**
	* **Outer Diameter? Guessing 4.34cm**
	* Each 10cm long and with a 
	* 1cm diam empty cilinder in the middle.

##Airframe

* Fin
	* shape: triangular
	* 5cm base
	* 15cm height
	* 0.4cm thick 
	* Material: wood (unknown)
* Nosecone
	* Shape: conical
	* Material: fiberglass
	* Weight: I'd say around 30g approx
* Total mass is is 1.65kg, no idea where cog is.
	* **This needs to be measured**
	
I have performed several static tests and 2 thrust measurements, burn time of the real rocket is 10seconds, max thrust 10kgf, average 6, 5-7, 5. I am doing another one tomorrow with 300g of fuel, to see a bit better how it behaves
